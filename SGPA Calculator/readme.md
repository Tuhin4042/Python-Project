# UGC Uniform Grading System

## Overview

The UGC Uniform Grading System is a Python program designed to calculate the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) for students based on their course credits and grades. This system implements a grading scale and provides academic results, including the total credits taken, SGPA, and remarks based on the calculated SGPA.

## Features

- Displays a grading scale with corresponding grade points.
- Allows input of student information such as name and ID.
- Accepts multiple courses, their credits, and the corresponding grade points.
- Calculates and displays individual course results.
- Computes the SGPA based on course credits and grades.
- Provides overall academic remarks based on the SGPA.

## Grading Scale

The grading scale used in the system is as follows:

| Marks Obtained | Letter Grade | Grade Point |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 80-100         | A+           | 4.00        |
| 75-79          | A            | 3.75        |
| 70-74          | A-           | 3.50        |
| 65-69          | B+           | 3.25        |
| 60-64          | B            | 3.00        |
| 55-59          | B-           | 2.75        |
| 50-54          | C+           | 2.50        |
| 45-49          | C            | 2.25        |
| 40-44          | D            | 2.00        |
| 0-39           | F            | 0.00        |

## Usage

1. Run the Python script in a suitable Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Input the required student details:
   - Name
   - ID
   - Total number of courses
3. For each course, input:
   - Course Name
   - Course Credit
   - Course Grade Point
4. The program will output the academic results, including:
   - Individual course grades and grade points.
   - Total credits taken.
   - Calculated SGPA.
   - Total Grade and Remarks based on the SGPA.
